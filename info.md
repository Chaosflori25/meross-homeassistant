# Meross Custom Component
Based on pure-python library, this custom component enables full control on your meross devices. 

## Features
* Supports Meross power plugs, included power metering/electricity measure
* Supports light bulb switching and color setting
* Supports Garage Door openers
* Supports multi-channel power strips 
* Event driven: no bandwidth is wasted

## Requirements
Please note that the Meross devices are controlled via Meross Cloud. This means that homeassistant 
should have internet access to accomplish such task.

## Be nice!
If you like the component, why don't you support me by buying me a beer or a coffe?
It would certainly motivate me to further improve this work.
